    "# Chapter 10. Files and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will tackle two important tasks. First, we will learn how to read and write files. Next, we will learn how to handle unexpected situations with *exceptions*. Lastly, we will also experiment with the `json` module, which allows you to save user data so it is not lost when your program stops running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading from a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Most data analysis will require you to read data from external files. Even if you don't deal with data, you may still need to access the contents of files, make changes, and then save your changes back to files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading the Contents of a File\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn a few things about how to read the contents of a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We need to import `Path` class from the `pathlib` library (a special kind of module proving specific functionalities).\n",
    "- We will use the `read_text()` method to read the contents in a file.\n",
    "- When Python reaches the end of a file, it returns an empty string. Therefore, your output includes one extra blank line, which you can strip off with `rstrip()` method.\n",
    "- You can use *method chaining* by connecting two methods together, e.g., `read_text().rstrip()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relative and Absolute File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data file is not stored in the same folder as your Python code file, you need to specify the correct folder, in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Relative file path.* If your data file is in a sub-folder (e.g., `data`) of your Python code, you can use this approach, such as `path = Path('data/filename.txt').\n",
    "- *Absolute file path.* Otherwise, it's easier to use absolute file path, e.g., `path = Path('c:/my document/filename.txt')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of your OS, we recommend that you always use forward slash (`/`) to specify file paths. Note, that Windows users are generally used to backslach (`\\`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing a File's Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you may want to examine each line of your file contents separately. In this case, you can use the `splitlines()` methods, followed by a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with a File's Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "In our `pi_digits.txt` example, we see that the data is split into multiple lines. If we want to combine all lines into one long string, we can do this in a `for` loop. To remove all the white spaces, we need to use the `lstrip()` method.\n",
