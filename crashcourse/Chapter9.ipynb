    "# Chapter 9. Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** represents a complete paradigm of coding practice. In OOP, you write *classes* that represent real-world things and situations. Then, you create *objects* based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a while class of objects can have. Then, when you create an object, it is automatically equipped with the general behavior in that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making an object from a class is called *instantiation* and you work *instances* of a class. You can also write classes that extend the functionality of existing classes, so similar classes can share common functionality. You can do more with less code. You will then store your classes in modules and import classes from other modules and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Using a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's create a class for dogs, called Dog. For illustration purpose, the Dog class has two attributes - name and age. It has two methods for two actions dogs can take - `sit()` and `roll_over()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Dog Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's syntax of defining a new class is `class Class_name:`. The convention is that class name should bbe capitalized. Unlike function definition, there is no `()` after class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `__init__()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of your class definition is always `__init()__` method. Method is almost the same as functions, so everything you've learned about functions applies to methods. In the `__init()__` method, you should always include a `self` paramneter, which creates an instance of the class. It gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class. You should include any other attributes to your class in the `__init()__` parameter list as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables defined under `__init()__` should normally include `self` prefix and these variables are called *attributes*. These variables are available to every method in the class, and we will also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define methods (functions) for the class. In the example below, there are two methods - neither requires any additional information to run, so we include only one parameter `self`. The instances we create later will have access to these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making an Instance from a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can make an individual instance of a dog, using the Dog class. The syntax is `instance_name = Class_name(attributes)`. Please note that you need to supply the attributes defined in the `__init()__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accessing Attributes. You can then access the attributes with `instance_name.attribute` notation.\n",
    "- Calling Methods. You can call any method defined in the class, with `instance_name.method()`.\n",
    "- Creating Multiple Instances. One of the major benefits of creating a class is because you can easily create many instances (with named variables or different slots in lists/dictionaries).\n"

    "## Importing Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to how you should package your functions into modules, you should also group all related classes in separate modules. Then, you have multiple different ways to import your modules and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of your class module, you should have an overall module-level docstring that describes the contents of this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Importing a Single Class.* In this case, you only need one class from a module, with `from module_name import Class_name`.\n",
    "- *Storing Multiple Classes in a Module.* You can also store all related classes in the same module. You initialize an instance the same way as if the class definition is in the same file.\n",
    "- *Importing Multiple Classes from a Module.* You can import multiple classes from the same module, by separating each class with a comma, e.g., `from module_name import Class1, Class2, Class3`. You initialize an instance the same way as if the class definition is in the same file.\n",
    "- *Importing an Entire Module.* You can also import the entire module, with `import module_name`. When you need to access classes, you need to add the module name as a prefix, e.g., `module_name.Class_name` syntax.\n",
    "- *Importing all Classes from a Module.* This approach is generally not recommended, because there might be naming conflicts. The syntax is `from module_name import *`.\n",
    "- *Importing a Module into a Module.* When you store related classes in different modules, sometimes, one class depends on another class from a different module. In this case, you need to import one module into another module. The importing code syntax is the same as above.\n",
    "- *Using Aliases.* As we see from importing functions in [Chapter 8](Chapter8.html), it is often easier to create an alias for long function (or class) name, e.g., `from electric_car import ElectricCar as EC`. Then, you can use `EC` as a shortcut to create instances of electric cars, e.g., `my_leaf = EC('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)`.\n",
