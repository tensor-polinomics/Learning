    "# Chapter 8. Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "For data scientists, how to write functions is one of the most useful skills. For almost any repetitive tasks, you should consider to wrap such tasks in a function. In this chapter, you will learn how to write various functions, from displaying information to processing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, if you have multiple functions that perform related tasks, you may want to put them in a module, which help organize your main program files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of writing a function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def function_name():\n",
    "    \"\"\"docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "    body\n",
    "```\n",
    "The way that you call your function is the same as any other built-in Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parsing Information to a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For most functions, you need to pass some information to them. For instance, in the example above, we want to greet users by their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments and Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code example below, `username` is a parameter. When you call the function and insert 'sarah', which becomes an argument. In this case, the argument 'sarah' was passed to the function `greet_user()`. **Note: In most cases, people use argument and parameter interchangeably.**"

    "## Passing Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Most functions have multiple parameters. These parameters can be specified either by position or by name (called *keyword argument*), where each argument consists a variable name and a value (or lists and dictionaries of values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positional Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make a function call, you can pass arguments in the same order as in function definition, which is called *positional arguments\". When you use positional arguments, you need to ensure you pass your arguments in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Function Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary reasons of writing functions is because you can use them repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyword Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires more efforts, but it is safer to use keyword arguments when you call a function. The function definition stays the same, but you specify each parameter explicitly in your function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Values\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define your functions, you can add optional default values. In this case, it simplify your users' experience, if the default value is used often.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equivalent Function Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically many ways to call a function, e.g., positional and keyword arguments. Make sure you follow the rules."

    "## Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "More often than displaying messages on the screen, your functions return a value or a set of values (called *return value*). The `return` statement within a function definition sends it back to the line that called the function. Return values allow you to move the heavy lifting work into functions, which dramatically simplifies the body of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returning a Simple Value\n",
    "\n",
    "When your function returns a value, and when you call the function, you need to provide a variable that the return value can be assigned to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making an Argument Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, certain arguments should be made optional. For example, in our `get_formatted_name()` function, if we want to add a middle name, it should be made optional (not everyone has a middle name).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returning a Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can return any kind of value, including more complicated data structures such as lists and dictionaries. Here is a function that takes in parts of a name and returns a dictionary representing a person. For optional argument, you could assign the default `None`.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Passing a List\n",

    "### Preventing a Function from Modifying a List\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you want your function to perform its intended purpose, but you also want to keep the original list intact. In this case, you can call your function on a copy of the list, instead of the list itself, with `function_name(list_name[:])`. Remember that using `[:]` means that you are copying a list. You should do this only if it's necessary. For large lists, processing on lists is more efficient than processing on their copies."

    "## Storing your Functions in Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "To better organize your code, you may want to store related functions in a separate file called a *module*. Then you can *import* that module into your main program. An `import` statement tells Python to make the code in a module available in the currently running program file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your modules, you can go one step further by compiling your modules, so users will not be able to see your source code (e.g., compiled bytecode `.pyc` file). You can also use a Python package manager such as `setuptools` or `wheel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run your code on Python shell, you may want to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import the directory management module with `import os`\n",
    "- Change your current directory to the folder where your Python file (.py) is stored with `os.chdir(r\"drive:/folder/\")`\n",
    "- Execute your Python code with `exec(open(\"python_code.py\").read())`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing an Entire Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach is to import the entire module and make every function available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `import module_name`\n",
    "- You can then call a function in the module with `module_name.function_name()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Specific Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only need one or a few specific functions from a module, you can import only those functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from module_name import function_name1, function_name2, ...`\n",
    "- Then you can call these functions directly without the `module_name` prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using as to Give a Function an Alias\n",
    "\n",
    "If the name of a function you are importing might conflict with an existing name in your program (or other modules you may use), or if the function name is unnecessarily long, you can use a short name, called *alias*, with a `as` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from module_name import function_name as fn` (here `fn` is my alias)\n",
    "- Then, you can call the function with `fn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using as to Give a Module an Alias\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also import the entire module and give it an alias:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `import module_name as mo`\n",
    "- Then, you can call any function in the moduel with `mo.function_name()`. This is very common within the data science world, e.g., `import panda as pd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing all Functions in a Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you can tell Python to import all functions in a module by using the asterisk (`*`) operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `from module_name import *`\n",
    "- This is equivalent to have all your functions in the same file as your main program. You should be careful of using this practice with large modules that you are not familiar with, because imported functions may have the same names as the functions you created."
