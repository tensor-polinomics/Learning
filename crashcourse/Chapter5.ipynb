    "# Chapter 5. Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are at the heart of almost all programming languages. In this chapter, we will learn the most powerful conditional statemnet in Python, the `if` and its variations. We will also learn how to combine `if` statement with `for` loops in lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "As a test drive, let's work on our `cars` list again. We will print each car in title case, unless it is a BMW, which we print in upper case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of `if` statement, Python conducts a series of conditional test. If it's `True`, the `if` statement is executed; if it's `False`, Python ignores everything after `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking for Equality\n",
    "\n",
    "In both Python and R, `=` is assignment operator (in R, `->` is preferred), while to test for equality, you have to use `==`. Note, Python is case sensitive. Therefore, if case doesn't matter, you are advised to convert everything to lower case before you compare them. For most websites, usernames are not case sensitive, while passwords are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking for Inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "For both Python and R, testing for inequality is `!=`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure numerical robustness when you test for equality, you can use `math.isclose()` function (from `math` library), which also allows you to set `rel_tol` (tolerance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Multiple Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "To build compound conditions, you need to use `and` and `or`, which are similar to `&` and `|` in R. To improve readability, we recommend to wrap your multiple conditions with paratheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking whether a Value is in a List or not in a List\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, to check whether one particular value is in a list, you use the keyword `in` (the equivalent in R is `%in%`). To check whether a value is *not* in a list, you add the keyword `not`. In R, you would do it slightly differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "value in list\n",
    "value not in list\n",
    "\n",
    "# R\n",
    "value %in% vector\n",
    "!(value %in% vector)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean expression is just another way of saying conditional test."
