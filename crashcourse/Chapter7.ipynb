    "This chapter covers two important topics. First, we will show you how to take user input with `input()` function, which your program will work with. Next, you will learn how to keep your program running, as long as certain conditions remain true, with the `while` loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your prompt has to be concise but more importantly clear. You can write long prompts spanning multiple lines. In this case, you should first wrap your prompt in a variable, and build it up with `+=`."
