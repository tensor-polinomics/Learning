# Main Purpose

This repo contains all my Python learning projects and exercises. It serves as a personal repository to track my progress and showcase the skills I've acquired in Python programming.

# Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

## sklearn Projects

This directory contains various machine learning projects implemented using the scikit-learn library. Currently, all Juypter notebooks are saved in the main directory, while _data_ and _figures_ have their own sub-folders. This folder also include other data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## PDA Projects

This directory includes projects related to Python Data Analysis (PDA). Similar to the sklearn*projects directory, all Juypter notebooks are saved in the main directory, with \_examples* organized into its respective sub-folder.
